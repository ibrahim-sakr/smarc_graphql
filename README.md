# Smarc GraphQL

hello folks, this is a simple self study for graphQL.

I was working on a IoT project called smarc, we implemented it with NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, SocketIO

we used to use a REST APIs, so why don't try something new ??

here I'm trying to implement all endpoints for the smarc with graphQL.

### Target

- implement a graphQL server with express, with the ability to use it with existing REST APIs
- architects the server to be handy for expanding
- solve the common problems with graphQL

    - separate every type and every Schema
    - N+1 problem
    - duplicated code
    - update and delete operations
    - authentication and authorization

## Install

```
git clone git@github.com:ibrahimsaqr/smarc_graphql.git
cd smarc_graphql
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```
